**Question 1:** The probabily of rolling a 7 is 1/6 and the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/36.

**Question 2:** The middle values between 2 and 12 have the most rolls. The extreme values (such as 2 and 12) have the least. 100 rolls is not sufficient in determining the relative frequency of all possible rolls.  The number of occurences of each roll do not have much of a difference and roll numbers that are close together are overlapped in rank during different runs.

**Question 3:** Increasing the number of simulations shows the rank of what number is rolled most clearly.  When the number of simulations was changed to 100,000,000, the results clearly show the order of most to least rolled would be as follows:
7,
6,
8,
9,
5,
4,
10,
11,
2,
12

**Question 4:** It took roughly 400,000 rolls per simulation in order to get the same 3 significant digits for 7 five times in a row. It took roughly 300,000 rolls per simulation in order to get the same 3 significant digits for 2 five times in a row.
